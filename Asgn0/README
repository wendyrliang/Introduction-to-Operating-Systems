The Makefile in this directory supports a number of targets for
building components (or all) of the FreeBSD source tree.  See build(7)
and http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/makeworld.html
for more information, including setting make(1) variables.

The `buildkernel` and `installkernel` targets build and install
the kernel and the modules (see below).  Please see the top of
the Makefile in this directory for more information on the
standard build targets and compile-time flags.

Building a kernel is a somewhat more involved process.  See build(7), config(8),
and http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/kernelconfig.html
for more information.
